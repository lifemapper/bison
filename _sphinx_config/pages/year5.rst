Objectives
----------------

2023, Year 5 SOW specifies building the project as an AWS application, so that USGS
personnel with little to no technical experience, and no local resources, can run the
analyses on a regular schedule.

The initial processes include annotating **GBIF occurrence data** from the
US, with designations from the **US Registry of Introduced and Invasive Species**
(RIIS), then summarizing the data by different regions, then aggregating data by a
geospatial grid of counties, and computing biodiversity statistics.

Regions include **US Census state and county boundaries**.  States are required
in order to identify whether the occurrence of a particular species falls within the
a RIIS region (Alaska, Hawaii, or Lower 48), where it is identified as "Introduced"
or "Invasive".  Region summaries include both state and county boundaries.

Regions also include **American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian** (AIANNH)
regions and **US Federal Protected Areas** (US‚ÄêPAD).

All regions (state, county, AIANNH, PAD) will be summarized by count and proportion
for species, occurrences, and RIIS status.
