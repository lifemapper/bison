Objectives
----------------


2022, Year 3 SOW specifies building the project as a well-documented Python application,
that can be run by technically proficient USGS personnel with adequate computing
resources.

The initial processes include annotating **GBIF occurrence data** from the
US, with designations from the **US Registry of Introduced and Invasive Species**
(RIIS), then summarizing the data by different regions.

Regions include **US Census state and county boundaries**.  States are required
in order to identify whether the occurrence of a particular species falls within the
a RIIS region (Alaska, Hawaii, or Lower 48), where it is identified as "Introduced"
or "Invasive".  Region summaries include both state and county boundaries.

All regions (state, county) will be summarized by count and proportion for species,
occurrences, and RIIS status.
